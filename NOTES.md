Notes for using this service broker.

main.go is the main class to invoke (run from this directory):

```
go run main.go
```

For the BOSH broker, use this:

```
ulimit -n 8192
# Ensure routes to 10.254.x.x are set up (through the bosh-lite IP)
# sudo route add -net 10.254.0.0/16 192.168.50.4
GOGOBOSH_TRACE=gogobosh.log go run main.go --service Bosh --copts assets/boshconfig.json
# OR
bin/build
GOGOBOSH_TRACE=gogobosh.log out/cb_service_broker --service Bosh --copts assets/boshconfig.json
```

Command line options

* --config path/to/config (default: assets/config.json)
* --service CLOUD (default: BOSH)

## TODO

* Tie the plans to what gets created.  The sizes in the plan should be passed in when creating an instance.
* Test this running in Cloud Foundry.
  * Issue: networking between Docker machine and CF
* Clustering of Couchbase

##Test the endpoints:

### Catalog

* GET the catalog:

```
curl http://localhost:7326/v2/catalog
```

### Service Instances
* GET a service instance:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:7326/v2/service_instances/{service_instance_guid}
```

* Create (PUT) a new service instance:

```
curl -X PUT http://localhost:7326/v2/service_instances/123 -d '{
  "organization_guid": "org-123",
  "plan_id":           "plan-123",

    "parameter2": "value"
 } }' -H "X-Broker-API-Version: 2.7" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

* DELETE a service instance:

```
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:7326/v2/service_instances/{service_instance_guid}
```

### Service Bindings

* Create (PUT) a new service binding:

```
curl -X PUT http://localhost:7326/v2/service_instances/{service_instance_guid}/service_bindings/{service_binding_guid} -d '{                                                                          1 â†µ

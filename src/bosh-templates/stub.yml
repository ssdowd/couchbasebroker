# this file will be dynamically built for a specific couchbase deployment (by a broker)
# Everything else is built from the static templates.  The list of templates used is
# determined by whatever invokes this (which needs to know which are appropriate).

# Values can be supplied dynamically during spruce invocation:
#    spruce merge --prune couchbase\
#        base-cb-deploy.yml \
#        network-bosh-lite.yml \
#        couchbase-job-defaults.yml \
#        stub.yml \
#        <(echo "name: couchbase-d")  \
#        <(echo "director_uuid: `bosh status --uuid`")  \
#    > deploythis-d.yml

# These *must* be overridden via heredocs in the spruce invocation
name: couchbase-deployment
director_uuid: a123456-9999-eeee-a1a1-123456abcdef

# These are defaults that *may* be overridden
